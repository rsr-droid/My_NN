# My_NN
The Iris data sets consists of 3 different types of irisesâ€™ (Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica) petal and sepal length, stored in a 150x4 numpy.ndarray  The rows being the samples and the columns being: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length and Petal Width.

This program converts the dataset into a binary classification problem to implement Neural Network alogorithm model.
